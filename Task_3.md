I first downloaded the csv file and moved it to the folder Github_task. To upload it to the repository, I opened Gitbash in that folder. Then I used git init to initialise the repository and I used git add with the address of the employee.csv file to add the file.I then committed the file using git commit -m "second commit". Consequently, I used git remote set-url origin with the link of the repository to set up a remote repository. After this I used git pull origin master to pull the changes in the repository and git push origin master to push the changes to the repository.
