I started by creating a README file and while saving it after clicking commit changes, I clicked on the 'Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request' option and named the new branch Temp. Then I clicked on Create pull request to save it. Now for merging the branch, I opened git bash and used git checkout master to switch to the master branch since we need to merge into that. Then I used git branch to see the branches and it did not show Temp so I used git remote update and it showed that the new branch is added. To merge the branch I used git merge origin/Temp --allow-unrelated-histories. Then I used git commit -m "merge" to commit the changes. When I tried to merge again using git merge and it said 'already up to date'.
