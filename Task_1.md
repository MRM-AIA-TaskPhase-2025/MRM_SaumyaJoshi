Making the folder on local system: I opened the command prompt and entered mkdir Github_task to create the folder. To navigate inside the folder, I used cd Github_task. Then to make the code file, I used echo print("Hello World") > helloworld.py and the file was created inside GitHub_task.

Uploading in GitHub repository: I right clicked on the GitHub_task folder and opened Git Bash there.Then to initialise the repository, I used git init. Then I used git add -A to add all the files (helloworld.py in this case). Then I used git commit -m "first commit" to commit the file to the repository. Then I used git remote add origin followed by the link of the repository. Then I used git push origin master which led to a notification to sign into github and connect to it.Once that was done,I went to settings and changed the default branch to master from main and the file then appeared on my repository.
